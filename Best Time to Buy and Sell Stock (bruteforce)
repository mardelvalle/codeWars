You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

var maxProfit = function(prices) {
    let greatest = 0
    for(let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
        let buy = prices[i]
        for(let e = i+1; e < prices.length; e++) {
            var dif = prices[e] - prices[i]
            if(dif > greatest) {
                greatest = dif
            }
        }
    }
    return greatest
};
