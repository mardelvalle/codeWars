Given a string of digits confirm whether the sum of all the individual even digits are greater than the sum of all the indiviudal odd digits. Always a string of numbers will be given.

If the sum of even numbers is greater than the odd numbers return: "Even is greater than Odd"

If the sum of odd numbers is greater than the sum of even numbers return: "Odd is greater than Even"

function evenOrOdd(str) {
  let even = 0
  let odd = 0
  for(let a = 0; a < str.length; a++) {
    let value = Number(str[a])
    value % 2 === 0 ? even += value : odd += value
  }
  if(even > odd) {
    return "Even is greater than Odd"
  }
  else if(even < odd ) {
    return "Odd is greater than Even"
  }
  else {
    return "Even and Odd are the same"
  }
}
