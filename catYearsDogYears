I have a cat and a dog.

I got them at the same time as kitten/puppy. That was humanYears years ago.

Return their respective ages now as [humanYears,catYears,dogYears]

var humanYearsCatYearsDogYears = function(humanYears) {
  // Your code here!
  let cat=0;
  let dog=0;
  let human=humanYears;
  for(let i=0; i<humanYears; humanYears--){
    if (humanYears==1){
      cat=cat+15;
      dog=dog+15;
    }
    else if (humanYears==2){
      cat=cat+9;
      dog=dog+9;
    }
    else{
      cat=cat+4;
      dog=dog+5;
    }
  }
  return [human,cat,dog];
}
